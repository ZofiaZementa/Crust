# This file contains a list of extended regular expressions, one per
# line. A file path matching any of these expressions will be filtered
# out during `darcs add`, or when the `--look-for-adds` flag is passed
# to `darcs whatsnew` and `record`. The entries in ~/.darcs/boring (if
# it exists) supplement those in this file.
# 
# Blank lines, and lines beginning with an octothorpe (#) are ignored.
# See regex(7) for a description of extended regular expressions.
